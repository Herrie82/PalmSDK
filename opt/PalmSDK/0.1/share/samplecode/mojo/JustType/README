As well as demonstrating the the API calls for DB8 this app also shows how an app can interact with the 
universal search.

Note the app has to be run first in order for the DB8 databases to be created.

In the Universal search preferences add this application to the application search's

Now enter the characters br, there are 2 places you can now launch the DB8 app from
1. Just under the google search you should see DB8 with the number 5 - this means there are 5 records within the app that match
Tapping on this brings up a listy of the results displaying each player (that matches the search) and the club.
Tapping on one of the names launches the DB8 app to that player.

2. In the universal search scroll down to "Quick Actions", you should see "Sample DB8". Tapping this will launch the app passing
the search string "br" to the app. The app in turn this uses the string to filter the list of players displayed.

As well as searching with in the app, universal search also allows the use of keywords. 
1. In the universal search enter dts, this should display the launch icon for DB8Sample just like entering DB8Sample would, except 
it will also display any other DTS samples that are installed with the keywords set in appinfo.json to "dts"

Look in the appinfo.json file for all the settings for each of the items above.
